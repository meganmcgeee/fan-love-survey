        <p>We've all experienced letdowns at conventions, parties, and with the media we love.</p>
        <p>At Power Level, we think the best way to avoid disappointment is to base production and planning on actual people - not stereotypes. That's why we do research like the survey you're about to take.</p>
        <p>This survey asks what you like to do at fandom events both alone and with your friends. </p>
        <p>The best answers are honest answers - don't be afraid to say what you think! </p>
